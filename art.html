<p>There are many forms of ceramic art, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tile</li>
<li>Tableware</li>
<li>Sculpture</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tile:</h2>
<p>Ceramic tiles have been used for covering roofs, walls, floors, and countertops for centuries. 
For uses inside, ceramic tiles are glazed. For outdoor uses like roofing, tiles are unglazed.</p>

<p>One way to make tiles is to roll out clay, cut it, shape it, and decorate it.</p>

<h2>Tableware:</h2>
<p>Tableware is anything that is used to serve food and drinks, or to decorate a table. 
Some examples are dishes, bowls, and cups. Although, pieces like cutlery are typically made of metal, not clay. 
Usually tableware is made on pottery wheels as dishes need to be symmetrical and easy to manufacture.</p>

<h2>Sculpture:</h2>
<p>Commonly, ceramic sculptures are less functional than tiles and tableware, and used more for decoration. 
Sculptures do not have to be very symmetrical, so the majority of pieces are not made with a pottery wheel, but by hand. 
Throughout history, mythological creatures and dieties, animals and humans have been popular subjects of sculpture.</p>

<p>These days, sculptures can be more abstract, with more modern themes or none at all. 
Also, since they are more decorative, pieces may be painted instead of glazed, and may include other materials. 
Ceramic sculpture is a popular for teaching younger artists about ceramics, as using pottery wheels is harder than hand building.</p>
