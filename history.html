<p>Humans started to use ceramics more during the Neolithic period, specifically in 9,000 BCE, as settled communities needed vessels for containing water and food.
At this time, ceramic art, tiles, and bricks also became popular. 
These pieces were sun-dried, then fired at a low temperature (below 1,000&#8451;) in kilns dug into the ground. 
They were usually one colour or painted with simple lines and patterns.</p>

<p>In 3,500 BCE, pottery wheels became popular in cities of the Indus Valley Civilization, which let potters make ceramic pieces that were more symmetrical. 
Pottery wheels continue to be popular for modern ceramic art and tableware.</p>
