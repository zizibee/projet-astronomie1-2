# *Website:* Space Exploration Efforts (LANGUAGE: FRENCH)

## Description ##
This website outlines space exploration efforts (as of April 2020) with content in French. In a team of 3, we 
planned and executed the representation of our research using HTML and CSS. Using the dropdown menu, users can
navigate through many different missions and learn more about them through the text and other media included. 

## Reflection

This project allowed me to practice different languages (both HTML/CSS and French) that I had freshly learned to 
explore outside interests. It was an opportunity to outline step-by-step how content should be organized and 
research new ways to display media like images. While it was challenging to research and create the website from
the ground up, it was rewarding to work through setbacks independently and by relying on my teammates. 

If I were to come back to this project, it would be interesting to revisit the space exploration missions we discussed
as well as update the formatting. I would also find a better way to cite sources and perhaps include links directly where
they were referenced.
